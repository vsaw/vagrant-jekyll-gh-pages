# Congratulations
When you are seeing this it means that [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is up and
running.

Here are some pointers to get you started

- [Themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/)
- [GitHub Themes](https://github.com/blog/1081-instantly-beautiful-project-pages)
- [GitHub hosting](https://pages.github.com/)

To shut down Jekyll type `vagrant halt`

Have fun!
